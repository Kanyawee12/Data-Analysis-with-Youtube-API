In this video, Jake introduces Mito AI where users can access ChatGPT from inside their Python environment. The user can have Mito AI complete tasks or answer questions with the data, and each edit will be reflected in the Mito interface, as well as generate the equivalent Python code. Mito AI allows the user to generate code with an LLM, and validate that the LLM was correct by seeing their data change in the spreadsheet in real time. Mito will highlight all the changes that the LLM makes, so the user can easily validate them.

J8GODfmKRHw,Data Professor,My journey into data science,"In this video, I talk about how I entered the field of data science as a self-taught. Briefly, I came from a non-technical background namely from biology where I have self-taught myself how to code as well as applying this to implement several data science pipelines. Although the journey was not particularly a straightforward path, I can attest that it is definitely possible for any aspiring data scientist.

F6CEXNb54TI,Data Professor,How to web scrape data using no code with Octoparse,"Often times we find ourselves in a situation where we need to collect data from websites but perhaps a big hurdle is limitation on the technical know-how that may traditional require extensive coding. In this video, I will provide a practical tutorial showing how you can web scrape data without coding knowledge by showing use cases on extracting data from YouTube, Twitter and Amazon in the form of structured spreadsheets (Excel and CSV file formats). Particularly, we will be using Octoparse (which is a no-code software and also the sponsor of this video) that you can use to perform web scraping in just a few clicks.

Particularly, we will be using the st.markdown function to embed HTML code for Bootstrap's Navbar.

This idea was inspired from a recent UI hack from Charly over at Streamlit where he used st.markdown to create clickable image buttons. This gave me the idea that it would also be possible to extend this to other things as well. Thus, the addition of navigation bar to Streamlit apps.

mX8ctLGR_FY,Data Professor,How to write a great looking research article using LaTeX on Overleaf,"In this video, I'll provide a step-by-step tutorial on how you can write a research article online on the Overleaf platform. Briefly, Overleaf is an online LaTeX editor that allows you to create great looking article layouts whether you are writing an article, a book, a thesis, a presentation slide or even a poster and curriculum vitae!

Aside from the great looks, another great thing about writing your article in LaTeX is that it has a built-in (nothing to install, just run the online editor) bibliography or reference formatting to the various journal formatting styles such as Vancouver, APA, etc. This especially comes in handy when one does not have access to reference formatting softwares such as Endnote or Mendeley.

Note: This video is not sponsored. I'm a long-time and early user of Overleaf as well as ShareLatex (which was eventually merged with Overleaf) and am currently using the Free plan.

rEmDyZHz5U8,Data Professor,How to build machine learning models for drug discovery using PaDELPy,"In this video, we will be building a machine learning model for a drug discovery dataset (consisting of compounds that can inhibit hepatitis C virus). Particularly, we will calculate molecular fingerprints using the PaDELPy library that are then used for building up a machine learning model using the Scikit-learn library.

PaDELPy is a Python wrapper for the Java-based PaDEL-Descriptor molecular descriptor calculation software. PaDELPy makes using the PaDEL-Descriptor software easy as we no longer have to invoke the bash command from within Python. Instead, we can use functions from PaDELPy as we would for any native Python library.

m0sePkuyTKs,Data Professor,Bioinformatics Project from Scratch - Drug Discovery #6 (Deploy Model as Web App) | Streamlit #22,"This is Part 6 in a multi-part video series on Bioinformatics Project from scratch. In this video, I will show you how to deploy the machine learning model as a web app. Essentially, this web app will serve as a Bioinformatics tool that will allow users the ability to predict whether a compound of interest has favorable biological activity against the target protein or not.

- Recap of Part 1, I have shown you how to collect original dataset in biology that you can use in your Data Science Project. Particularly, I have demonstrated how to download and pre-process the biological activity data from the ChEMBL database. The dataset is comprised of compounds (molecules) that have been biologically tested for their activity towards target organism/protein of interest. 
- Recap of Part 2, I have shown you how to calculate Lipinski descriptors (molecular descriptors proposed by Christopher Lipinski for predicting their likelihood of being drug-like molecules) and performing Exploratory Data Analysis on these Lipinski descriptors. Particularly, the EDA are based on making simple box plots and scatter plots to discern differences of the active and inactive sets of compounds.
- Recap of Part 3, I have made some changes to the target protein to be Acetylcholinesterase as it provides a larger dataset to work with. We have already computed the molecular descriptors using the PADEL-Descriptor software and prepare the dataset (X and Y dataframes) that will be used in this video for Model Building.
- Recap of Part 4, I have show you how to use the computed molecular descriptors from Part 3 (as the X variables) to build a regression model for predicting the pIC50 values (the Y variable).
- Recap of Part 5 in a multi-part video series on Bioinformatics Project from scratch. In this video, I will show you how to quickly build and compare several regression models (quantitative structure-activity relationship or QSAR) of the Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors using the lazypredict library in Python.

gKCDSiRRyUo,Data Professor,How to examine chance prediction of a machine learning model (Y-Scrambling / Y-Permutation),"Have you ever wondered whether your machine learning model is a chance prediction? In this video, I will show you how to prove that your machine learning model is either truly making robust predictions or whether it is chance prediction. Particularly, we will be performing Y-scrambling (aka Y-randomization, Y-permutation, etc.) whereby values in the Y column will be shuffled such that the resulting X-Y pair will be a null pair that is expected to give rise to poor model performance while the original X-Y pairs will lead to a good performance if the model is truly robust.

htBIP17S-20,Data Professor,How to build a Bioinformatics web app (Molecular Descriptor Calculator) in Python | Streamlit #21,"In this video, I will be showing you how to build a molecular descriptor calculation web app in Python using the Streamlit library. Briefly, this molecular descriptor app is a Bioinformatics tool that will allow you to describe the unique molecular features of compounds in numerical form that can then be used to build predictive models using machine learning for predicting drug bioactivity, biological activities and chemical properties. Such models are also known as quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) and quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models. Under the hood the bioinformatics tool that we will be building is based on using the PaDEL-Descriptor software for calculating molecular properties of compounds.

9a234-OvbIQ,Data Professor,Let's Build a Pomodoro Web App for Data Science | Streamlit #15,"In this video, I will be showing you how to build your very own Pomodoro web app in Python using the Streamlit library. Pomodoro is a popular time management technique for increasing productivity, study as well as coding. In essence, it involves the breakdown of time to a period of 25 minutes of dedicated deep focus followed by a 5 minute break, which makes up one cycle. Hopefully, you will be able to customize this for increasing your data science productivity.

A cool tweak to the Pomodoro technique was made by @yugiohforce1 where he replaced ""watching Anime"" instead of the ""break time"" and he called this the Animedoro (anime + pomodoro). Check out his Animedoro video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUjGZJIgse0 and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74q-HD852lI

FoRsn1VwEbA,Data Professor,Bioinformatics Project from Scratch - Drug Discovery Part 5 (Compare Models),"This is Part 5 in a multi-part video series on Bioinformatics Project from scratch. In this video, I will show you how to quickly build and compare several regression models (quantitative structure-activity relationship or QSAR) of the Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors using the lazypredict library in Python.

- Recap of Part 1, I have shown you how to collect original dataset in biology that you can use in your Data Science Project. Particularly, I have demonstrated how to download and pre-process the biological activity data from the ChEMBL database. The dataset is comprised of compounds (molecules) that have been biologically tested for their activity towards target organism/protein of interest. 
- Recap of Part 2, I have shown you how to calculate Lipinski descriptors (molecular descriptors proposed by Christopher Lipinski for predicting their likelihood of being drug-like molecules) and performing Exploratory Data Analysis on these Lipinski descriptors. Particularly, the EDA are based on making simple box plots and scatter plots to discern differences of the active and inactive sets of compounds.
- Recap of Part 3, I have made some changes to the target protein to be Acetylcholinesterase as it provides a larger dataset to work with. We have already computed the molecular descriptors using the PADEL-Descriptor software and prepare the dataset (X and Y dataframes) that will be used in this video for Model Building.
- Recap of Part 4, I have show you how to use the computed molecular descriptors from Part 3 (as the X variables) to build a regression model for predicting the pIC50 values (the Y variable).

FG68qNVZF2s,Data Professor,How NVIDIA NGC can be used for Data Science (Podcast + Giveaway),"In this video, I had the pleasure to talk with Adel El Hallak, the Director of Product Management at NVIDIA NGC where we discuss how the NGC can be used for Data Science. NGC is a FREE resource that you  can use for your Data Science Projects. NGC provides you access to a large library of GPU-optimized software that include containers, pre-trained models, Helm charts for Kubernetes deployments and industry specific AI toolkits with software development kits (SDKs). I learned that NGC can help save data scientists time by allowing quick adoption of pre-trained models and ready to use docker containers of top AI and data science software that has been tuned, tested and optimized by NVIDIA.

Qs0V5ntEWWQ,Data Professor,Explainable AI in Python with LIME (Ft. Diogo Resende),"In this video, Diogo Alves de Resende will be showing us how to use LIME to explain a machine learning model's prediction in Python. LIME or Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations makes it possible to understand black box classifiers which is an exciting field known as Explainable AI.

Local surrogate models are interpretable models that are used to explain individual predictions of black-box machine learning models. Local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) is a paper in which the authors propose a concrete implementation of local surrogate models. Surrogate models are trained to approximate the predictions of the underlying black-box model. Instead of training a global surrogate model, LIME focuses on training local surrogate models to explain individual predictions.

The idea is quite intuitive. First, forget about the training data and imagine you only have the black-box model where you can input data points and get the model's predictions. You can probe the box as often as you want. Your goal is to understand why the machine learning model made a specific prediction. LIME tests what happens to the predictions when you give variations of your data into the machine learning model. LIME generates a new dataset consisting of permuted samples and the corresponding predictions of the black-box model.

Diogo is the author of 4 machine learning courses on Udemy http://bit.ly/3nMTixd

Alphafold 2 is a computational framework developed by Deepmind for protein structure prediction and in the recent Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP14), Alphafold 2 outscored other contenders by a huge margin by scoring in excess of 80 and in some categories in excess of 90 GDT. (Note: A score higher than 90 is on par with experimental methods such as the X-ray crystallography). This represents a big milestone for artificial intelligence (AI) and demonstrates the possibilities that AI has to offer.

Alphafold 2 is a computational framework developed by Deepmind for protein structure prediction and in the recent Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP14), Alphafold 2 outscored other contenders by a huge margin by scoring in excess of 80 and in some categories in excess of 90 GDT. (Note: A score higher than 90 is on par with experimental methods such as the X-ray crystallography). This represents a big milestone for artificial intelligence (AI) and demonstrates the possibilities that AI has to offer.

BSU8wkM9FAE,Data Professor,Ask Me Anything About Bioinformatics #2,"🌟Don't forget to check out Episode #1 of the ""Ask Me Anything"" series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQQ3X9OxxJ0

In this video, I will be continuing the ""Ask Me Anything"" series by answering a question in Bioinformatics from one of the subscriber. Particularly, I will be talking about how chemical structures are encoded in a one-dimensional format known as the SMILES notation whereby they are used by molecular descriptor softwares for computing molecular descriptors and molecular fingerprints. The molecular descriptors are then used for machine learning model building as the X matrix for predicting the Y variable (the drug bioactivity).

Molecular descriptors describes the unique physicochemical properties and molecular properties of each molecule. Molecules are broken down to their substructures and the resulting molecular fingerprints will span hundreds to thousands of descriptors where each fingerprint is assigned a value of 0 or 1 to denote the absence or presence of the substructure of interest.

The question asked by Dylan was ""Is there a reason to use paDel finger print over something like SMILE? I would guess that paDel may have more clear functional group information. But I have read ML papers that have used SMILE to great success""

TidyTuesday:
✅ https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday

Although the data resource is provided by the R community, the dataset could readily be used in any programming language. This data resource can definitely be used in a Python data science environment. For example, the Coffee Ratings dataset can be accessed directly from the following URL: 
✅ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-07-07/coffee_ratings.csv
whereby the above URL can be found under the heading ""Get the data here"" from the main page of the Coffee Ratings data:
✅ https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-07-07/readme.md
(The same concept applies for all other datasets provided by TidyTuesday.

wGaGm0sj04M,Data Professor,Bioinformatics Project from Scratch - Drug Discovery Part 4 (Model Building),"This is Part 4 in a multi-part video series on Bioinformatics Project from scratch. In this video, I will show you how to use the computed molecular descriptors from Part 3 (as the X variables) to build a regression model for predicting the pIC50 values (the Y variable).

🌟 Buy me a coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/dataprofessor

Recap of Part 1, I have shown you how to collect original dataset in biology that you can use in your Data Science Project. Particularly, I have demonstrated how to download and pre-process the biological activity data from the ChEMBL database. The dataset is comprised of compounds (molecules) that have been biologically tested for their activity towards target organism/protein of interest. 

Recap of Part 2, I have shown you how to calculate Lipinski descriptors (molecular descriptors proposed by Christopher Lipinski for predicting their likelihood of being drug-like molecules) and performing Exploratory Data Analysis on these Lipinski descriptors. Particularly, the EDA are based on making simple box plots and scatter plots to discern differences of the active and inactive sets of compounds.

Recap of Part 3, I have made some changes to the target protein to be Acetylcholinesterase as it provides a larger dataset to work with. We have already computed the molecular descriptors using the PADEL-Descriptor software and prepare the dataset (X and Y dataframes) that will be used in this video for Model Building.

Particularly, we will be building a Penguins species classification web app using the Palmer Penguins dataset (4 quantitative variables and 3 qualitative variables; 1 of the qualitative variable will be used as the target variable for classification).

zD2focOkQ48,Data Professor,Bioinformatics Project from Scratch - Drug Discovery Part 3 (Dataset Preparation),"This is Part 3 in a multi-part video series on Bioinformatics Project from scratch. In this video, I will show you how to take the project that we have built so far further. However, I have some changes to the target protein to be Acetylcholinesterase as it provides a larger dataset to work with. We will then compute the molecular descriptors using the PADEL-Descriptor software and prepare the dataset (X and Y dataframes) that will be used in the next part for Model Building.

🌟 Buy me a coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/dataprofessor

Recap of Part 1, I have shown you how to collect original dataset in biology that you can use in your Data Science Project. Particularly, I have demonstrated how to download and pre-process the biological activity data from the ChEMBL database. The dataset is comprised of compounds (molecules) that have been biologically tested for their activity towards target organism/protein of interest. 

Recap of Part 2, I have show you how to calculate Lipinski descriptors (molecular descriptors proposed by Christopher Lipinski for predicting their likelihood of being drug-like molecules) and performing Exploratory Data Analysis on these Lipinski descriptors. Particularly, the EDA are based on making simple box plots and scatter plots to discern differences of the active and inactive sets of compounds.

⭕ Code:
As we have changed the target protein to Acetylcholinesterase, here are the new notebook files:

qWVTxfLq2ak,Data Professor,Bioinformatics Project from Scratch - Drug Discovery Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),"This video represents Part 2 in a multi-part video series on Bioinformatics Project from scratch. In this video, I will be showing you how to take the dataset from Part 1 and use the SMILES notation (representing the unique chemical structure of compounds) to compute molecular descriptors. The descriptors that we will be computing are the Lipinski's descriptors (molecular weight, LogP, number of hydrogen bond donors and number of hydrogen bond acceptors). Finally we will then perform exploratory data analysis by making simple box plots and scatter plots to discern differences of the active and inactive sets of compounds.

🌟 Buy me a coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/dataprofessor

Recap of Part 1, I have shown you how to collect original dataset in biology that you can use in your Data Science Project. Particularly, I have demonstrated how to download and pre-process the biological activity data from the ChEMBL database. The dataset is comprised of compounds (molecules) that have been biologically tested for their activity towards target organism/protein of interest.
