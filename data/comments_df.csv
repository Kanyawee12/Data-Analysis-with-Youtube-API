So before I ask the questions, I wanted to explain a bit of my situation. I graduated from Uni with a bachelor's of science in bioinformatics back in 2019, and have since then have not done much in regards to bioinformatics and it is mostly due to me not knowing how or where to start. I have looked for jobs in bioinformatics close to me but out of the little I find, most of the time I never hear back from the companies. I notice that most binf jobs require a master's degree which has led to to consider taking a master's course at some university. However I am conflicted with going back to school because I feel as if it is not required given that there are a lot of binf projects one can do at home. I basically feel stuck in that I can't get a proper response from an employer and I suspect it is due to my lack of experience of which I don't know how to acquire. Given this I have started considering applying for other jobs that are not related to the binf field as a way to start getting money which is a bit depressing. So my questions are this:\n\nShould I go back to school to pursue a graduate degree ?\n\nHow can I gain experience in bioinformatics of which I can add to a resume to make me more appealing to employers? \n\nLastly, I feel as if I might not be looking for jobs correctly. I mostly go on Indeed or google and search for bioinformatics jobs. so my last question is: \n\nHow do I search for bioinformatics jobs? this includes private and research jobs. \n\nThanks for reading this comment."", 'Hello sir this is Priyanka already completed my graduation and postgraduation in bioinformatics but still struggling because there is not much scope in our country and infact some labs like CSIR and many more they are considered much belongs from Life sciences not specifically in bioinformatics so could you tell me about some institutions or lab in india where I can apply.', ""Hi Professor, May I know in bioinformatics what's the size of the data you guys deal with usually?"", 'Another question please. For someone going into bioinformatics industry, is it more profitable to learn data science/ML or software engineering skills? Thanks again!']"
